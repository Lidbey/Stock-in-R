# Stock-in-R
My personal research on trying to predict stock prices in R with arima

Conclusion is not very good, as I got 0,1,0 arima with lowest EIC, so tomorrow price got only 1 'lag' factor, which is of course nothing new in case of stock analysis. It's my current project I will work on later when I will have some time
